# About Me
I'm in the final year of my Physics PhD at UC Berkeley, working with [Chung-Pei Ma](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~cpma/). I study how stars move within their galaxies. I'm particularly interested in what we can learn about the shapes of galaxies, as well as the central supermassive black holes that they host.

I'm originally from North Vancouver, BC, Canada, and graduated with my undergraduate degree in Mathematical Physics from Simon Fraser University in 2016. My undergraduate honours thesis was on the relationship between the information-theoretic learning rate and energetic efficiency, and was supervised by [David Sivak](https://www.sfu.ca/physics/people/faculty/dsivak.html). I also spent time studying pulsar scintillation with [Ue-Li Pen](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pen/wordpress/) at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, as well as analyzing data from the ATLAS experiment with [Dugan O'Neil](https://www.sfu.ca/research/directory/dugan-oneil) and the SFU High Energy Physics Group.
