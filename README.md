## About Me
I'm in the final year of my Physics PhD at UC Berkeley, working with [Chung-Pei Ma](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~cpma/). I study galaxies and the supermassive black holes that lie in their centers. I'm originally from Vancouver, BC, Canada, and did my undergraduate degree in Mathematical Physics at Simon Fraser University. I did my undergraduate Honours Thesis in theoretical biophysics under the supervision of [David Sivak](https://www.sfu.ca/physics/sivakgroup.html).
